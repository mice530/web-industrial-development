#Compress Javascript/CSS files
>This example shows how to compress file with uglify, which has been transformed into a grunt plugin(grunt-contrib-uglify).

By running ‘grunt basic’, you may get command line message as followed:
```shell
grunt basic
```
```shell
Running "uglify:build" (uglify) task
File dest/basic/*.min.js created: 187 B → 69 B

Done, without errors.
```

```shell
grunt basic
```
```shell
Running "uglify:build" (uglify) task
File dest/basic/*.min.js created: 187 B → 69 B
Done, without errors.
```
